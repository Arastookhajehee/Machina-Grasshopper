# Machina for Grasshopper

Machina is a simple and intuitive Grasshopper plug-in for real-time robot programming and control.

Machina simplifies all the hassle of writing programs in platform-specific languages by providing a human-relatable API of Actions, unified for all the different devices. In tandem with the Bridge app, Machina streamlines connecting to a physical device, one-click streaming of full programs, monitoring their execution in real time and reacting to their state. It is particularly suitable for applications that need to be aware and reactive to changes in the robot environment, like real-time 3D printing, pick and place of objects with changing positions, and connection to sensing devices.

Machina is a fully open-source project. You can find more information here:
